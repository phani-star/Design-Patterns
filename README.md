ðŸ§  Design Patterns in Java This repository contains practical implementations of key Object-Oriented Design Patterns in Java, grouped into three major categories: Creational, Behavioral, and Structural. Each pattern is implemented with clarity and modularity, making it easy to understand, extend, and benchmark.

ðŸ§© What Are Design Patterns? Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They help improve code readability, reusability, and scalability by offering standardized approaches to object creation, interaction, and structure.

ðŸ“š Pattern Summaries You can optionally add short blurbs like these under each category:

Creational Patterns
===================
Builder: Constructs complex objects step-by-step.

Factory: Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic.

Prototype: Clones existing objects for performance or customization.

Registry: Centralized object lookup and management.


Behavioral Patterns
====================
Observer: One-to-many dependency updates.

Strategy: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms.

Structural Patterns
===================
Adapter: Bridges incompatible interfaces.

Decorator: Adds responsibilities dynamically.

FaÃ§ade: Simplifies complex subsystem interactions.

Flyweight: Shares common state to reduce memory usage.
